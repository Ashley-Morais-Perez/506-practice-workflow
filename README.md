# 506-practice-workflow
This assignment is as a primer for 504/507 Fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow 
I initially ran this project on cloud shell but when it came time to push the file, the terminal wouldn't let me copy and paste my token, and the 'push' kept failing. I tried running the file here on Code space and it ran with no issues. However, I couldn't figure out how to display the grade pass/fail functions clearly like I was able to do in the Cloud Shell Python terminal.

I used numbers indicating test grades and student's first/last name for my variables. The If/else functions used HW and test grades to print whether the student had failed or passed (I was more focused on getting the print function to work, there's no reason as to why one grade is a pass and the other is a fail). The dictionary contained the student's information with a nested dictionary of the student's degree.
